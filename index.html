<div class="blurb">
	<h1>Hi there, I'm Nishit Jain!</h1>
	<p>I am a <em>Data Scientist</em> if you go by my designation. But in reality, I am just another guy implementing the data science and machine learing algorithms to build cool and challenging stuff. With that out of the way, I am a space guy. I like to read about outer space and universe as a whole. Also, I like to write, travel, wander and wonder.<br><br> I am a fan of narrating my life adventures and experiences and also I cook up some of the stories just to spice things because who you are if you can't tell stories that live.<br><br><a href="https://villageinfo.in/rajasthan/sirohi/pindwara/veerwara.html"><em>Veerwara</em></a>, a small village in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirohi"><em>Sirohi</em></a> district of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan"><em>Rajasthan, India</em></a> is where I was born and raised till I left for my higher secondary education to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udaipur"><em>Udaipur, Rajasthan</em></a> which is the most beautiful city I have ever been to. Having schooled with Science & Mathematics as my major subjects, I went to <a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/"><em>University of Pune</em></a> to get my <em>Engineering</em> degree in <em>Information Technology</em>. When I was in my fourth year of engineering, I got interested in the field of <em>Data Science & Machine Learning</em> and decided to make my career in it because you should do what you love so that one day you can proudly say, "I love what I do".<br><br>If you believe we have common interest and have an exiciting project to work on, drop me a mail. I will be more than excited to collaborate.  <a href="/about">Details Here</a><br><br> Thanks to <a href="https://pages.github.com/"><em>Github Pages</em></a> & <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/"><em>Jekyll</em></a>. This would not be possible without these two.</p>
